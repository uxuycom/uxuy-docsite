Please read these Terms carefully as they govern your use of our website located at our
Site https://uxuy.com (the “Site”), and use of the products, features, content, applications,

behalf of a company or other legal entity, you have the legal authority to bind the company
or other legal entity to these Terms and you are at least 18 years old (or the age of majority
where you reside, whichever is older), can form a legally binding contract online, and have

rule, statute, regulation, by-law, order, protocol, code, decree, or other directives,
requirement or guideline, published or in force which applies to or is otherwise intended to

## 2. SERVICES
The "UXUY smart contracts" are publicly available open-source software programs deployed
on the Ethereum blockchain that facilitate the peer-to-peer exchange of Ethereum-based
tokens.

UXUY develops software through which users and developers can interact with the UXUY
smart contracts. The primary purpose of the Site is to enable users to access and utilize the
UXUY smart contracts and UXUY software products as well as to provide resources and
information, including, without limitation, developer documentation, product examples, and
other related services (all of which are covered under the definition of “Services”).

The “UXUY network” is comprised of all users, companies, applications, and any other
device, service, or person interacting in any way, directly or indirectly, with the UXUY smart
contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, including UXUY’s Services. The term UXUY network
should be interpreted as broadly as possible to include anything that may be reasonably
considered to be part of the network as that term is construed in normal use.

Some Services are offered by us or other participants in the UXUY network require payment
or otherwise involve the use of an underlying blockchain or other decentralized or
permissioned infrastructure (the “Distributed Ledger Technology”), which may require that
you pay a fee, such as “gas” charges on the Ethereum network, for the computational
resources required to perform a transaction on the particular Distributed Ledger Technology
(such payments and fees, “Charges”).

You acknowledge and agree that UXUY has no control over any Distributed Ledger
Technology transactions, the method of payment of any Charges, if applicable, or any actual
payments of Charges, if applicable. Accordingly, you must ensure that you have a sufficient
balance of the applicable Distributed Ledger Technology network tokens stored at your
Distributed Ledger Technology-compatible wallet address (“Distributed Ledger Technology
Address”) to complete any transaction on the UXUY network or the Distributed Ledger
Technology before initiating such transaction.As a condition to accessing or using the Services or the Site, you: (i) will only use the Services and the Site for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms; (ii) will ensure that all
information that you provide on the Site is current, complete, and accurate; (iii) will maintain
the security and confidentiality of access to your Distributed Ledger Technology Address;
and (iv) agree (A) that no Protected Party (defined below) will be responsible for any loss or
damage incurred as the result of any interactions you have with other users of the Site,
Services or the UXUY network, including any loss of the tokens issued in the future by UXUY,
any other tokens or other unit of value; and (B) if there is a dispute between you and any
other site or other user, no Protected Party will be under any obligation to become involved.


As a condition to accessing or using the Site or the Services, you will not: (i) Violate any
Applicable Law, including, without limitation, any relevant and applicable anti-money
laundering and anti-terrorist financing laws and any relevant and applicable privacy and data
collection laws, in each case, as may be amended; (ii) Export, re-export, or transfer, directly
or indirectly, any UXUY technology in violation of applicable export laws or regulations; (iii)
Infringe on or misappropriate any contract, intellectual property, or another third-party
right, or commit a tort while using the Site or the Services; (iv) Misrepresent the
truthfulness, sourcing or reliability of any content on the Site or through the Services; (v) Use
the Site or Services in any manner that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect, or
inhibit other users from fully enjoying the Site, Services or the UXUY network or that could
damage, disable, overburden, or impair the functioning of the Site, Services or the UXUY
network in any manner; (vi) Attempt to circumvent any content filtering techniques or
security measures that UXUY employs on the Site or the Services, or attempt to access any
service or area of the Site or the Services that you are not authorized to access; (vii) Use any
robot, spider, crawler, scraper, or other automated means or interface not provided by us, to

horse, worm, logic bomb, drop-dead device, backdoor, shutdown mechanism or other

otherwise process information about you.

## 4. CHANGES; SUSPENSION; TERMINATION

Services provided by UXUY. Accordingly, we may, at our sole discretion, from time to time
and with or without prior notice to you, modify, suspend or disable, temporarily or
permanently, the Services offered by UXUY, in whole or in part, for any reason whatsoever,
including, but not limited to, as a result of a security incident.

We will not be liable for any losses suffered by you resulting from any modification to any
Services or from any suspension or termination, for any reason, of your access to all or any
portion of the Site or the Services.

violation of applicable laws or regulations; or your infringement or misappropriation of the
rights of any other person or entity. If you are obligated to indemnify any Protected Party,

transactions, including, but not limited to, the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations
promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”), the

constitute advice or a recommendation concerning any commodity, security, or other assets.
UXUY is not acting as an investment adviser or commodity trading adviser to any person.

UXUY does not have the ability to modify or control in any manner the code underlying the
smart contract. The ability to modify the UXUY smart contracts is managed by a multi-
signature wallet currently controlled by UXUY and described in more detail here. In general,
the underlying protocols are open-source and anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute
them. UXUY is not responsible for the operation of the underlying protocols such as
Ethereum, and UXUY makes no guarantee of its functionality, security, or availability.

of their content or functionality) provided by or on behalf of us are provided on an “AS IS”
and “AS AVAILABLE” basis, and we expressly disclaim, and you hereby waive, any
representations, conditions or warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, legal,
statutory or otherwise, or arising from statute, otherwise in law, course of dealing, or usage
of trade, including, without limitation, the implied or legal warranties and conditions of
merchantability, merchantable quality, quality or fitness for a particular purpose, title,
security, availability, reliability, accuracy, quiet enjoyment and non-infringement of third
party rights. Without limiting the foregoing, we do not represent or warrant that the Site or
the Services (including any related data) will be uninterrupted, available at any particular
time or error-free. Further, we do not warrant that errors in the Site or the Service are
correctable or will be corrected.

irretrievably lost or corrupted or temporarily unavailable due to a variety of causes, and

any loss or damage caused by denial-of-service attacks, software failures, viruses or other
technologically harmful materials (including those which may infect your computer
equipment), protocol changes by third-party providers, Internet outages, force majeure
events or other disasters, scheduled or unscheduled maintenance, or other causes either
within or outside our control.

extent such warranties cannot be excluded or limited under the Applicable Law of the
jurisdiction in which you reside.

indirect, special, punitive, exemplary, consequential or similar damages or liabilities

goodwill, profits or other business or financial benefit) arising out of or in connection with
the Site, the Services, and the UXUY Network (and any of their content and functionality),
any execution or settlement of a transaction, any performance or nonperformance of the
Services, your Distributed Ledger Technology assets, other digital assets, or any other
product, service, or other item provided by or on behalf of a Protected Party, whether under
contract, tort (including negligence), civil liability, statute, strict liability, breach of
warranties, or under any other theory of liability, and whether or not any Protected Party
has been advised of, knew of or should have known of the possibility of such damages and
notwithstanding any failure of the essential purpose of these Terms or any limited remedy
nor is UXUY in any way responsible for the execution or settlement of transactions between
users of UXUY open-source software or the UXUY Network.


## 9. ACCESS TO THIRD-PARTY DERIVATIVES PROTOCOLS

perpetual contract trading protocols. These protocols are developed and operated
independently by third parties. UXUY does not control, maintain, operate, or act as a

peer-to-protocol basis.

###  User Responsibilities
You are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of derivatives-related functionality is
lawful under the laws of your jurisdiction. Access to such features may be restricted in
certain regions by law or by the technical configuration of the underlying protocols. You

the Site, the Services, and the UXUY Network (and any of their content and functionality),

YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY APPLICABLE PROVISION IN LAW OR REGULATION IN CONNECTION WITH THE FOREGOING, WHICH STATES IN SUBSTANCE: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.


##  12. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION
Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain
disputes and claims with UXUY and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us,
unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. In addition,
arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.

You and UXUY agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services
is personal to you and UXUY and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual
action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of
representative proceeding.

Except for small claims disputes in which you or UXUY seeks to bring an individual action in
small claims court located in the county or other applicable jurisdiction where you reside or
disputes in which you or UXUY seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged
unlawful use of intellectual property, you and UXUY waive your rights to a jury trial and to
have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services resolved in court.
Instead, for any dispute or claim that you have against UXUY or relating in any way to the
Services, you agree to first contact UXUY and attempt to resolve the claim informally by
sending a written notice of your claim (“Notice”) to UXUY by email at legal@uxuy.com. The
Notice must include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number,
describe the nature and basis of the claim, and set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice
to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and UXUY cannot reach an
agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then
either party may submit the dispute to binding arbitration administered by the JAMS, or,
under the limited circumstances set forth above, in court. All disputes submitted to JAMS
will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration
proceedings will be held in California, in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive
Arbitration Rules & Procedures (“JAMS Rules”). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules
are available on the JAMS Site and are hereby incorporated by reference. You either
acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your
opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or
should not apply for any reason.

You and UXUY agree that the enforceability of this Section 11 will be substantively and
procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the “FAA”), to the
maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the
AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and
substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise
be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The
arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than
one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or
preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.

The arbitrator, UXUY, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration
proceedings, judgments and awards, including, but not limited to, all information gathered,
prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the disputes. The
arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality,
unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the
extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the
merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with
a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that
disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.


You and UXUY agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and UXUY
will pay the remaining AAA fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by UXUY, UXUY will
pay all AAA fees and costs. You and UXUY agree that the courts of Germany have exclusive
jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.
Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services must be filed within one
year after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that
you and UXUY will not have the right to assert the claim.


You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first
accepted the terms of this Section 11 by emailing us at legal@uxuy.com. In order to be
effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate
your intent to opt-out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are
agreeing to resolve disputes in accordance with Section 11.

If any portion of this Section 11 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, the
unenforceable or unlawful provision will be severed from these Terms, severance of the
unenforceable or unlawful provision will have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of
this Section 11 or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an
individual basis under this Section 11, and to the extent that any claims must therefore
proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be
litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties
agree that litigation of those claims will stay pending the outcome of any individual claims inarbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 11 is found to prohibit an individual claim
seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is
allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 11 will be
enforceable.

Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain
disputes and claims with UXUY and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.


You and UXUY agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services
is personal to you and UXUY and that any such dispute shall be finally resolved by binding
arbitration administered by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC) under
the HKIAC Administered Arbitration Rules in force when the Notice of Arbitration is
submitted. The seat of arbitration shall be Hong Kong. The arbitration shall be conducted in
English. The governing law of the arbitration shall be the laws of the Cayman Islands.


Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services must be filed within one
year after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred.


## 13. GOVERNING LAW
The interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and any dispute related to these Terms, the Site, or the Services, will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Germany, as applicable, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. You agree that we may initiate a proceeding related to the enforcement or validity of our intellectual property rights in any court having jurisdiction. With respect to any other proceeding that is not subject to arbitration under these Terms, the courts located in Germany will have exclusive jurisdiction. You waive any objection to venue in any such courts.

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Cayman Islands, without regard to its conflict of law principles. You agree that we may initiate a proceeding related to the enforcement or validity of our intellectual property rights in any court having jurisdiction. With respect to any other proceeding that is not subject to arbitration under these Terms, the courts located in Hong Kong shall have exclusive jurisdiction. You waive any objection to venue in any such courts.


##  14. MISCELLANEOUS

Any right or remedy of UXUY set forth in these Terms is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other right or remedy whether described in these Terms, under Applicable Law, at law or in equity. Our failure or delay in exercising any right, power, or privilege under these Terms will not operate as a waiver thereof. The invalidity or unenforceability of any of these  Terms will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other of these Terms, all of which will remain in full force and effect. We will have no responsibility or liability for any failure or delay in performance of the Site or any of the Services, or any loss or damage that you may incur, due to any circumstance or event beyond our control, including without limitation any flood, extraordinary weather conditions, earthquake, or other act of God, fire, war, insurrection, riot, labor dispute, accident, action of government, communications, power failure, or equipment or software malfunction. You may not assign or transfer any right to use the Site or the Services, or any of your rights or obligations under these Terms, without our express prior written consent, including by operation of law or in connection with any change of control. We may assign or transfer any or all of our rights or obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, without notice or obtaining your consent or approval. Headings of sections are for convenience only and will not be used to limit or construe such sections. These Terms contain the entire agreement and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings between the parties regarding the Site and the Services. If there is a conflict between these Terms and any other agreement you may have with us, these Terms will control unless the other agreement specifically identifies these Terms and declares that the other agreement supersedes these Terms.
