# GasPool - Enabling Transfers and Transactions Without Gas

In UXUY, you don't need Gas to perform transfers. UXUY comes with a built-in Gaspool, allowing you to conduct on-chain transactions like transfers without the need for Gas.

[Download UXUX](https://uxuy.com/zh-Hans/download) now to get your Gaspool limit instantly.

As it is well known, traditional EOA wallets require Gas Fees for all on-chain interactions, and MPC wallets are no exception. Both types of wallets are decentralized, and all on-chain interactions require Gas.

In line with our commitment to the idea that 'even novice users should be able to use a wallet,' we have developed the Gaspool wallet infrastructure. This significantly lowers the entry barrier for wallet users and achieves a 'zero' threshold wallet that can be used even by novices.
