## Network transaction fees

UXUY charges a transaction fee of 0.03% of the transaction amount, which is primarily used for the operation of UXUY services, marketing operations, and commission rebates from transaction fees.
The miner's fee is collected on-chain and covers the cost of network gas for on-chain synchronization. It is collected by the blockchain network's nodes and miners, and UXUY does not charge users any additional fees.
