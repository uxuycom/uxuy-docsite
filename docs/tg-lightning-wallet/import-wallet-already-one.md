# [Welcome to UXUY](https://blog.uxuy.com/about)

No, currently we do not support the import feature for wallets from other services. Each Lightning Network account created with us is unique and tied to your Telegram (TG) account, operating independently from other Lightning accounts. We recommend that you send your previous assets to your new UXUY Lightning Wallet address. Once you've done that, you can enjoy the benefits of low-cost, delay-free transactions that our service offers.
