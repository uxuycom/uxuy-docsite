# Will My Wallet Be Lost? 

Your UXUY Lightning Wallet, integrated for swift and hassle-free transactions via Telegram (TG) with the aid of end-to-end encryption, is connected to your TG account. Should your TG account fall into the wrong hands or be lost, there is a risk of losing access to your wallet along with its funds.
Preventive Measures to Safeguard Your Wallet:
- Enable Two-Step Verification: To bolster the security of your TG account and, by extension, your UXUY Lightning Wallet, we strongly recommend setting up two-step verification. You can follow the steps outlined in the Telegram FAQ: How Does Two-Step Verification Work.
- Limit to Small Transactions: It's advisable to use your UXUY Lightning Wallet for smaller deposits and transactions only. This practice can help mitigate potential losses in the event of an account compromise.
- Stay Tuned for Updates: Keep an eye on our updates. We are continuously working to enhance security measures and will be rolling out additional features to protect our users more effectively.
