# Copy Trading Guide

## How to Start Copy Trading

Before you begin, make sure your account has at least **100 USDT** as starting capital.

If your balance is insufficient, click 👉 **On-chain Deposit** or **Fiat Deposit**. We recommend funding via **BNB**, **BASE**, or **SOLANA** chains.

:::tip
For transfers above **10 USDT**, **GAS fees are waived**.
:::

## What Is Copy Trading?

Copy trading means **automatically replicating professional traders' actions**:

- They open a position → Your wallet opens the same position
- They close or adjust → Your wallet mirrors the move

👉 In short, it's **"professional trading + self-managed funds"**, ideal for beginners or busy investors.

## How Copy Trading Works & Account Structure

To ensure transparency and fund security, here's how it works:

- Copy trading uses **independent accounts**, separate from contract accounts
- When you follow a trader, the system automatically creates a **dedicated copy-trading account**
- All trades are executed via the **Hyperliquid protocol**
- A **proxy wallet** is created to perform trades automatically

:::warning Important Security Feature
**⚠️Proxy wallets have no withdrawal rights**, ensuring complete fund safety.
:::
- Once you stop following, your remaining margin is returned automatically.

## What Is Proportional Copy Trading?

UXUY supports **proportional copy trading**, replicating trades based on the leader's margin ratio.

**Formula:**
```
Copy Ratio = Leader's Used Margin ÷ Leader's Total Margin × 100%
```

**Example:**
- Leader has 1,000 USDT and opens BTC with 500 → Ratio = 50%
- You follow with 500 USDT → System opens the same position with 250 USDT

## Supported Trading Pairs

Currently supports **100+ perpetual contract pairs**, consistent with UXUY contract markets.
