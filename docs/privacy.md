How We Share Your Information with Third Parties.

We also share user information with third parties in some other circumstances as follows:
Employees, Third-Party Processors and Third-Party Service Providers.

We disclose your information to our employees, contractors, affiliates, distributors, dealers, vendors and suppliers ("Service Providers") who provide certain services to us or on our behalf, such as operating and supporting the Service, analyzing data, or performing marketing or consulting services. These Service Providers will only have access to the information needed to perform these limited functions on our behalf.

Response to Subpoenas or Court Orders or to Protect Rights and to Comply with Our Policies.
To the extent permitted by law, we will disclose your information to government authorities or third parties if:

1.  required to do so by law, or in response to a subpoena or court order or similar request from judicial authority;
    we believe in our sole discretion that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect against fraud, to protect the property or other rights of us, or

2.  other users, third parties or the public authorities or we believe that you have abused the Services by using it to attack other systems or to gain unauthorized access to any other system, to engage in spamming or otherwise to violate applicable laws.

You should be aware that, following disclosure to any third party, your information may be accessible by others to the extent permitted or required by applicable law, unless specific restrictions have been implemented.

In the event of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of our assets, any user information owned or controlled by us may be one of the assets transferred to third parties. We reserve the right, as part of this type of transaction, to transfer or assign your information and other information we have collected from users of the Services to third parties.

Other than to the extent ordered by a bankruptcy or other court, the use and disclosure of all transferred user information will be subject to this Privacy Policy. However, any information you submit or that is collected after this type of transfer may be subject to a new privacy policy adopted by the successor entity.

Aggregated Information.

We may share information relating to users of the Service with affiliated or unaffiliated third parties on an anonymous, aggregate basis. While this information will not identify you personally, in some instances these third parties may be able to combine this aggregate information with other data they have about you, or that they receive from third parties, in a manner that allows them to identify you personally.

## Our Affiliates.

We may share some or all of your information with our parent company, subsidiaries and corporate affiliates, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us.

### Data Processor

The Data Processor refers to any natural or legal person who processes personal data on behalf of the Data Controller. In certain situations, we may engage third-party service providers as Data Processors to assist in the provision of services and the processing of personal data.

### Legal Basis for Processing

Under the Cayman DPA, personal data can be processed only when there is a lawful basis for doing so.

2. Right to Rectification: The right to request the correction of inaccurate personal data.
3. Right to Erasure: The right to request the deletion of personal data under specific circumstances, such as when the data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected.

### Data Security

UXUY is committed to implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security and confidentiality of personal data. These measures are designed to protect personal data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

### Data Transfer

In certain circumstances, personal data may be transferred to third parties, including Data Processors, outside of the Cayman Islands. Such transfers will be subject to appropriate safeguards to ensure the protection of personal data, as required by the Cayman DPA.

### Data Breach Notification

In the event of a data breach that is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, UXUY will promptly notify the relevant supervisory authority and, where necessary, affected individuals, in accordance with the requirements of the Cayman DPA.
