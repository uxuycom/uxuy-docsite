## Key Features

### Built on ERC-4337 Protocol
 UXUY is a smart contract-based decentralized exchange built on the abstract account standard **ERC-4337**. Leveraging its proprietary **GasLess** protocol, UXUY breaks the limitations of traditional EOA wallets, delivering a seamless, "chain-agnostic" trading experience. Even users unfamiliar with Web3 can start trading on-chain stocks, index funds, and multi-chain assets with just one click—offering Web2-level ease of use and security

### ⚡ GasLess: Proprietary Gas-Free Interaction Protocol
In traditional blockchain systems, every transfer or smart contract interaction requires paying gas fees, which complicates the user experience. UXUY’s self-developed **GasLess** protocol eliminates this burden, allowing users to broadcast and execute on-chain transactions with **zero gas cost**, lowering the barrier to blockchain trading.

### 🌉 Built-in Cross-Chain Bridge: Native Protocol for Seamless Multi-Chain Experience
UXUY features an in-house cross-chain protocol based on stablecoin channels, enabling **instant cross-chain transfers and trading**. Users no longer need to rely on third-party bridges, sign repeatedly, or switch networks—UXUY provides a one-click multi-chain asset swap and trading experience with **zero perceptible delay**, significantly reducing the learning curve for Web3 adoption.

### 🔄 Multi-Chain Interaction Protocol: Smart Aggregation & Routing for Optimal Trades
UXUY’s proprietary cross-chain infrastructure powers a **real-time multi-chain aggregation and smart routing system**. When a trade is initiated, the system automatically queries multiple chains to identify the optimal blockchain, protocol, and price path, ensuring **low slippage, high efficiency**, and near-instant cross-chain execution.

### 📈 On-Chain Stocks and Index Fund Trading
UXUY introduces Real World Assets (RWA) to the blockchain, enabling **24/7 on-chain trading** of popular U.S. stocks like Tesla and Apple, along with a variety of crypto-based index funds. This brings traditional financial products into the decentralized world, offering global users flexible and continuous investment opportunities.
